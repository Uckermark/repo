                properly with all devices on iOS 12+. It features a modern UI that
                emphasises native UI elements, with fully native package depictions on
                supported repos! It also allows repositories to handle payments seamlessly
                and natively with payments secured by Touch/Face ID.\n\nSileo uses the
                latest versions of both DPKG and APT to ensure that users get the best
                possible experience with the latest optimizations and stability fixes
                applied for both. Both DPKG and APT have minimal patches to ensure they
                may continue to be updated, while still being compatible with most
                existing iOS repositories.",

                infrequently-used APT features have not been brought over to Sileo to keep
                it lean and fast.\n\n#### Integrated\n\nBecause Sileo has been built with
                the latest DPKG and APT in mind, they all have been updated to ensure they
                work together in the most efficient manner possible. Great effort has been
                taken to ensure that the entire process from app launch to package
                installation has been streamlined, with no processes being duplicated
                where possible, to ensure a better, faster, and more stable overall
                experience.\n\n#### Free\n\nSileo is available, free of charge, for all
